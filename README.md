# This is a DIY automatic cat litter box.

### 3/8/2025 update: V2 is now ready, way more capable, and it now supports all litter types, pellets included, it does the sifting part automatically. Documentation update will follow. 

## Keynotes:
1. Battery powered.
   It is using an NRF52832, standby on 6x18650 batteries is about a Year. Real life usage with 4 cats allowed for 3 months between charges, ~400 cleaning cycles.
2. Removable sand scoop part.
   The part that scoops the sand is one hand removable, easy cleaning/maintaining.
3. Waterproof.
   It s based on a servo, the battery holds in place using a magnet, can be taken out and everything else, including the base, can be placed under running water.
5. Silent mechanism.
   It uses a servo and a stadard 10mm bit and screw, cut at the side for top loading, no squeaking sounds, nothing can get stuck in there.
6. Failproof safety.
   Besides the logic, is also uses the powerbank module to cut off power in a case of overload, the servo is then released, there is no way to harm a cat.

It runs on espruino.
